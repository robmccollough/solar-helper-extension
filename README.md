# solar-helper-extension
-Helper extension to save time copy-pasting from a certain solar power account website to a certain business analytics website.
-Made by robmccollough for a friend in need
-To use this extension requires logging in to both websites and navigating to the required account/lead pages.
-No sensitive information is stored within the extension whatsoever.
-Uses only vanilla javacript and the chrome storage API.

For the future:
  -Update popup UI to include a 'ready' feedback
  -Move to using jquery to parse data in stead of cascading getElementById
  -Switch from using 4 action buttons to 1 'run' button to seamlessly transition data while both tabs are open
  -Just have fun with it and learn something :)
